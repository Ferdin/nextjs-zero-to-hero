In this lecture, you will learn about the props and children.

Props are inputs you pass to a component to customize its behavior or content.
Think of props like arguments to a function, but for a component.

In this example, we create a component that passes three props.

With typescript, you need to specify the shape and type of props. 

Let's create a component with three props - name, placesVisted and year. They are of types string, string array and then a number type.

First, define the props type (similar to how we defined object types in a previous lecture)

type GreetingProps = {
  name: string;
  placesVisited: string[];
  year: number;
};

Now create the component function:

export default function TypeScriptProps({
  name,
  placesVisited,
  year,
}: GreetingProps) {

}

Now we construct our component based on the props.
return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello {name}</h1>
      <ul>
        {placesVisited.map((place, index) => (
          <li key={index}>{place}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <h2>{year}</h2>
    </div>
  );

Go to app then page.tsx.

Import the component.

<TypeScriptProps
        name="Ferdin"
        placesVisited={["Lisbon", "Rome", "London"]}
        year={year}
      />

Let's go to the browser and see how it looks.

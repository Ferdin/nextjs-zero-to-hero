Week 2 â€“ React Refresher + TypeScript for Next.js
ðŸ”¹ Part 1: React Refresher
1. React Core Concepts

What is React? (UI as a function of state)

JSX basics (embedding variables, conditional rendering, lists with map)

Components:

Function components vs. class components (focus on functions)

Props & children

2. State & Events

useState hook (basic state management)

Handling events (onClick, onChange)

Controlled components (form inputs)

3. Lifecycle & Side Effects

useEffect hook (fetching data, cleanup)

Dependency arrays and avoiding infinite loops

4. Component Composition

Passing props down

Lifting state up

Parent/child communication

5. Lists & Keys

Rendering arrays with .map()

Importance of key prop

6. Context & Props Drilling

Problem: deeply nested props

Solution: useContext for global state

7. Conditional Rendering

Ternary operator and short-circuit rendering (&&, ||)

ðŸ”¹ Part 2: TypeScript for React

(From my previous message â€” but taught after refresher)

1. TypeScript Basics

Type annotations (string, number, boolean)

Arrays, tuples, objects

any vs unknown vs never

2. Props & Components

Typing props in function components

Typing children

Typing event handlers (ChangeEvent, MouseEvent)

3. Hooks

Typing useState, useReducer

Typing useRef

Custom hooks with generics

4. Next.js Specific

Typing params and searchParams

Typing API routes (NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse)

Typing data fetching functions

5. Advanced TypeScript Patterns

Utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit)

Discriminated unions

Type guards & narrowing

If you havenâ€™t installed Node.js on your computer, go to this link and download it:

ðŸ‘‰ https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Once installed, check if it was successful by opening the Command Prompt (or terminal) and typing:

node --version


If you see a version number, the installation was successful.
This installation also comes with npm (Node Package Manager) and npx (a package runner tool). Weâ€™ll use npx to create our Next.js app.

Install a Code Editor

The next tool you need is a code editor.

I recommend Visual Studio Code (VS Code) since it comes with many features and extensions that make development easier and faster.

ðŸ‘‰ Download it here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Create Your First Next.js App

Create a new directory anywhere on your computer.

Open it in VS Code.

Inside VS Code, open the integrated terminal and run:

npx create-next-app@15.5.2 my-first-next-app


When prompted, choose the following options:

TypeScript â†’ Yes

ESLint â†’ Yes

Tailwind CSS â†’ Yes

src/ â†’ Yes

App Router â†’ Yes

Turbopack â†’ Yes

Import alias â†’ No (this option allows you to create shortcuts for imports, e.g., @/components/Button instead of ../../components/Button. Weâ€™ll keep it simple for now.)

The installation may take a few minutes.

Run Your Next.js App

Navigate into your new project:

cd my-first-next-app


Then start the development server:

npm run dev


ðŸ‘‰ This script is defined in the package.json file (weâ€™ll go over this in the next lecture).

If you see the Next.js welcome page in your browser, congratulations! ðŸŽ‰
Youâ€™ve successfully set up your development environment and your first Next.js app is ready to build.
